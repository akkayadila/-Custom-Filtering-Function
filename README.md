# Custom Filtering Function

Aim of this task is to create a custom filtering function in Rust that allows filtering elements and returning a new collection containing only the elements that match a specific filter condition. 
In my program, a vector of numbers are filtered by a given filter number and only the numbers matching the filter numbers are returned.
